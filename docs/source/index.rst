django-siteblocks documentation
===============================

http://github.com/idlesign/django-siteblocks

*django-siteblocks is a reusable application for Django to build blocks of static or dynamic data that could be used in templates.*

It allows you to describe data that doesn't clearly belong to any application in your project in terms of static or dynamic blocks,
that could be rendered in certain places on site pages. These blocks are addressed in templates by their aliases.
